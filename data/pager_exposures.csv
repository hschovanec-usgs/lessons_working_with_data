#
#This data represents the results of running the PAGER exposure and loss
#algorithms on the output from ShakeMap.
#
#Notes: "Total" in the country column indicates that the results in that row are
#the sum of exposures/losses for all affected countries.
#
#"predicted_fatalities" and "predicted_dollars" are the results of applying loss
#models to the exposure data - note that these values are not guaranteed to
#match the actual losses from the earthquake.
